//! VGA text-mode buffer driver.
//!
//! This module provides a safe(ish) abstraction for writing text to the VGA
//! text buffer at memory address `0xb8000` in 80x25 text mode.
//!
//! It supports:
//! - Colored text output
//! - Line wrapping and scrolling
//! - `print!` / `println!` macros similar to the Rust standard library
//!
//! All writes to VGA memory are performed using volatile accesses to ensure
//! the compiler does not optimize them away.
