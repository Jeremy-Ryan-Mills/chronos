//! Kernel crate root.
//!
//! This is the top-level entry point for the kernel as a Rust library crate.
//! It wires up core subsystems (GDT/TSS, IDT/PIC, basic output), provides a
//! simple custom test framework for `cargo test` in QEMU, and includes a few
//! small utilities used across the kernel.
